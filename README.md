## development
To run the component as an electron react component:

```
yarn dev
```


## building


```
yarn build
```

## cleaning


```
yarn clean
```


## testing


```
yarn test
```

## publishing


```
npm publish
```

## known issues
- Directory path will always resolve relative to the electron.js file. A workaround is to use path.resolve. Example below:

```
const path = window.require('path')
// I search for a file inside src/component/utils/certs , then use below code:
const certsFolderPath = path.resolve('src/component/utils/certs');
console.log(certsFolderPath) // /Users/xxxxx/alya/asm-date-time/src/component/utils/certs
```

- To require an npm module from a react component, do like:

```
const path = window.require('path')
```
